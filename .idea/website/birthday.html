                <p>Without you I would probably be still sad. So I want to
                    <code class="property">thank you</code> from the bottom of my
                    <code class="selector">Heart.</code>
                    Meeting me wasnt a coincidence love, it was already decided. We just have to
                    <code class="property"> always believe </code>
                    in eachother and this is something I have made for you. A kind of replacement for a letter,
                    <code class="property">a simple thank you.</code>
                    Youre amazing for everything. Youre hard work, determination, even laziness;
                    <code class="selector"> I miss you.</code>
                    I honestly do not know what to write. I cant express my love for you through words. This infinte love is hard to comprehend in simple words.</p>

                <p>Im <code class="selector">proud of you tho,</code>
                    I know it must be hard doing this kind
                    <code class="property">relationship</code>
                    with me but itll be worth it. I promise.
                    <code class="selector">My love.</code>
                    Did I ever tell you that youre the most beautil woman? Its not about looks alone, but rather the simple flaws and the fact that
                    <code class="selector">you are mine.</code>
                    Its without lying the best, really the best that ever happened. </p>

                <p>By setting the <code class="selector">.content</code> elements to <code class="property">position: fixed</code>, we can now transition between them without a visible scrolling movement.</p>

                <p>We create a normal <code class="selector">@keyframe</code> animation to our liking to transition between them. Check the navigation menu to see different effects.</p>

                    <li>Scrolling animations are not currently available in Firefox. This demo is using a polyfill.</li>
                    <li>This layout is fragile due to the use of <code class="property">position: fixed</code>. You need to carefully manage stacking contexts.</li>
                    <li>Snapping points have their own caveats, such as content taller than the viewport becoming inaccessible, along with the general annoyance of scrolljacking.</li>
                    <li>The <code class="selector">blink</code> effect uses the <code class="property">contrast()</code> filter, which modifies the colors of the entire section. Thus, the background is set to black (or white), ensuring that it appears unchanged during transitions due to already being at maximum contrast.</li>
